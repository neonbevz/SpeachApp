## What is **Speach**?
```
Speach is an app that allows you to google quickly. Even quicker.
Have you listened to a speech so interesting that googling a simple definition seems like forever?
We had.
That's when we dreamt about the search bar proposing us what we want to google automatically.
Then we screamed - 'why not?!'
Well, we didn't scream, that was a speech, but still.
```

## How this works?
```
When activated, **Speach** listens  to conversations and extracts keywords and definitions.
All of them are dynamically available, and you can google them with a single click. Or leave for later.
